# Unit 18 NoSQL Homework: Workout Tracker

## Overview 

The NoSQL database is something other than a table. There are several different types of NoSQL databases, such as key-value and graph. In this unit we will learn MongoDB, a document-oriented NoSQL database. MongoDB documents correspond to a row, or record, in SQL, but unlike rows, documents are analogous to JSON objects. 

## User Story

* The user will be able to view create and track daily workouts. I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled. The consumer will reach their fitness goals more quickly when they track their workout progress.
